# Programmer Brain Training Roadmap (JavaScript)

> Goal: Train my brain to think like a programmer so I can solve problems confidently.

---

## Chapter 1: What Programming Really Is
- Programming = giving tiny, literal instructions
- Difference between syntax vs problem-solving
- Why beginners feel stuck (normal phase)

---

## Chapter 2: Literal Thinking
- Think like a robot, not a human
- Break actions into the smallest steps
- Practice converting daily tasks into instructions

---

## Chapter 3: State (Core Concept)
- What variables really represent
- Understanding memory and changing values
- Why counters depend on state

---

## Chapter 4: Flow & Execution
- Code runs top to bottom
- Events (clicks) vs normal execution
- Predict what happens before running code

---

## Chapter 5: Problem Breakdown
- Split problems into:
  - Input
  - State
  - Action
- Learn how to start any problem

---

## Chapter 6: Counter Patterns
- Counters exist everywhere (likes, score, cart)
- One pattern → many use cases
- Spot counters in real apps

---

## Chapter 7: English → Pseudocode → JS
- Write logic in plain English first
- Convert English to pseudocode
- Translate pseudocode to JavaScript

---

## Chapter 8: Debugging Mindset
- Bugs = feedback
- Use `console.log` to trace thinking
- Step-by-step value tracking

---

## Chapter 9: Build the Counter (Deep)
- Create counter from scratch
- Increment, decrement, reset
- Understand every line (no copying)

---

## Chapter 10: Problem-Solving Framework
- Reusable thinking system
- Stay calm with new problems
- Practice the right way

---

### Final Goal
✅ Stop freezing on problems  
✅ Think step-by-step  
✅ Solve basic JS problems confidently
